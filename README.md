- Update README.md
- Create wrapper library for lanterna, enough to use [muli-windows](https://github,com/mabe02/lanterna/blob/master/docs/tutorial/Tutorial04.md) to develop the game.

## Other

I once planned on writting this game in Python. I didn't get very far, but what I did get done still exists under the name [evolution_of_light_python](https://github.com/kaymanb/evolution_of_light_python).
